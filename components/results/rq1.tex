\spoilsport successfully initialized 1,324 of 1,376 (96.3\%) ERC-20 contracts with a timeout of 30 seconds.
\autoref{tab:rq1-timing} summarizes the timing statistics, showing a quick mean time (1.54s).

\revs{\spoilsport failed to initialize states for 51 transactions.} 
\todo{it is not clear to me where is the solver.}
Of the 51 failures (3.7\%), state initialization 
failed for 38 contracts (74.5\% of failures) 
%failed were 
due to the solver timing out. A further 13 contracts (25.5\% of failures) failed due to issues accessing or 
identifying the \texttt{balances} variable.

As shown in \autoref{ss:fig:rq1-init-length-distro}, lengths \revs{of state initialization sequence} ranged from 
two to twelve transactions, with the most frequent being lengths of three (940 contracts, 71.1\%), five 
(164 contracts, 11.9\%) and four (98 contracts, 7.1\%). The vast majority (1,239, 93.5\%) of these sequences 
consisted solely of \texttt{transfer} calls. This is consistent with the general pattern of all token being minted 
to a single address upon deployment, and that address then disbursing the funds.

This demonstrates that the declarative state specification using role/goal semantics is effective (96.3\% success) and efficient (median 0.52 seconds) for large-scale analysis, even in the adversarial setting of compromised ERC-20 contracts found in the wild.

\begin{result}
    \spoilsport successfully initialized 96.3\% (1,324) ERC-20 contracts quickly (mean 1.54s).
